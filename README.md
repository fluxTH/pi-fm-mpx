Pi-FM-MPX
=========

## FM-MPX transmitter based on the Pi-FM-RDS project.

This program is a modified fork from the [Pi-FM-RDS](https://github.com/ChristopheJacquet/PiFmRds) project by Christophe Jacquet.

pi-fm-mpx allow you to pipe MPX audio and directly broadcasting it via RPi's PWM pin.

It is based on the FM transmitter created by [Oliver Mattos and Oskar Weigl](http://www.icrobotics.co.uk/wiki/index.php/Turning_the_Raspberry_Pi_Into_an_FM_Transmitter), and later adapted to using DMA by [Richard Hirst](https://github.com/richardghirst). Christophe Jacquet adapted it and added the RDS data generator and modulator. The transmitter uses the Raspberry Pi's PWM generator to produce VHF signals.

It is compatible with both the Raspberry Pi 1 (the original one) and the Raspberry Pi 2, 3 and 4.

pi-fm-mpx has been developed for experimentation only. It is not a media center, it is not intended to broadcast music to your stereo system. See the [legal warning](#warning-and-disclaimer).

## How to build and use it?

Make sure that the following dependencies are installed: 

- libsndfile
- libsoxr

It also depends on the Linux `rpi-mailbox` driver, so you need a recent Linux kernel. The Raspbian releases have this starting from August 2015.

**Important.** The binaries compiled for the Raspberry Pi 1 are not compatible with the Raspberry Pi 2/3, and conversely. Always re-compile when switching models, so do not skip the `make clean` step in the instructions below!

Clone the source repository and run `make` in the `src` directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fluxth/pi-fm-mpx.git
cd pi-fm-mpx/src
make clean
make
```

**Important.** If `make` reports any error, then no `pi_fm_mpx` executable file is generated (and vice versa). So any error must be fixed before you can proceed to the next steps. `make` may fail if any required library is missing (see above), or it could be a bug on a specific/newer distribution. In this case, please file a bug.

If `make` reports no error (i.e. the `pi_fm_mpx` executable gets generated), you can then run the program:

```
ffmpeg -i mpx.flac -c:a pcm_s16le -f wav - | sudo ./pi_fm_mpx -audio -
```

This will generate an FM transmission on 107.9 MHz, with default station name (PS), radiotext (RT) and PI-code, without audio. The radiofrequency signal is emitted on GPIO 4 (pin 7 on header P1).

The more general syntax for running Pi-FM-MPX is as follows:

```
./pi-fm-mpx <-audio file|-> [-freq 107.9] [-rate auto|192000] [-ppm 0] [-gain 1.0]
```

## Warning and Disclaimer

pi-fm-mpx is an **experimental** program, designed **only for experimentation**. It is in no way intended to become a personal *media center* or a tool to operate a *radio station*, or even broadcast sound to one's own stereo system.

In most countries, transmitting radio waves without a state-issued licence specific to the transmission modalities (frequency, power, bandwidth, etc.) is **illegal**.

Therefore, always connect a shielded transmission line from the RaspberryPi directly
to a radio receiver, so as **not** to emit radio waves. Never use an antenna.

Even if you are a licensed amateur radio operator, using PiFmRds to transmit radio waves on ham frequencies without any filtering between the RaspberryPi and an antenna is most probably illegal because the square-wave carrier is very rich in harmonics, so the bandwidth requirements are likely not met.

I could not be held liable for any misuse of your own Raspberry Pi. Any experiment is made under your own responsibility.
